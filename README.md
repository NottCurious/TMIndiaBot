### Update (26th October, 2021)
* We now do not need to run a seperate command terminal just for the api.
* The bot will no longer work unless you have access to the private api repo. Please contact the developers if you want access to clone it
* If you have access, please clone the repo into util/node/

### Update (12th December, 2021)
* The API is now Open Source, you can find it [here](https://github.com/artifexdevstuff/TMIndiaBotApi "TMIndiaBotApi Github Link")
* API bugs out when a new COTD is released (roughly 11:30pm IST), a fix is being worked on by tmio devs
* You can also opt to clone the API seperately and run it from there, the bot has a confirmation prompt for running the api
