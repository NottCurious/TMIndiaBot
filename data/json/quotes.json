Came to TM2020 with lots of hopes riding on his young shoulders, some called him the Indian Gwen. He wanted to be in the league of top Indian Players, he knew he can do it. Tried so hard to win the first ever Standard access competition, but fell just short. He went back to the drawing boards, grinded hard and won the next competition with just hours to spare. Came back next day to play the cup as an underdog, many discounted him to even be top 3. But he surprised everyone! Went into finalist with NottCurios, he knew he could win. But he realized more than being a great player he was a great person as well. So he let NotCurrious win bcoz otherwise he would go into depression, and then let Namy be finalist bcoz he still had respect for veterans, and then finally got a well deserved 2nd place. GG!",
